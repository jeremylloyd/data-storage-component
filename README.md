## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS
- JS (Svelte)

### What I learned

- CSS Container queries
- Svelte Components
  - It's hard to reuse Components if you need to apply a lot of different styles to each instance. If it gets too hard and you find yourself passing too many styling arguments to each component, just make a new component for your use case
- Svelte Stores
